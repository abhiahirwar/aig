  					<p class="large-text">In an IG Blinds® system, the blind is fully contained and sealed within the glass panels of an IGU – triple glazing is also an option.</p>
					<p>Movement of the blind for manual or motorised systems does not compromise the thermal properties of the IGU, as the system is performing in a totally sealed environment.</p>

					<p>Units are customised and manufactured to meet individual project specifications, with toughened safety glass and argon as standard in every IG Blinds® system manufactured in Australia. Glass specifications can be customised to meet individual design or thermal performance criteria.</p>
  				</div>
  				<div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-5 wow fadeInLeft">
  					<p>The unique IG Blinds® manufacturing system ensures total protection against dirt, dust, or weather conditions, thereby guaranteeing minimal maintenance (if any) and the magnetic components have been tested to have an almost indefinite life cycle. The wide product choice and versatility of operation also make IG Blinds® internal blind systems suitable for all types of framing systems.</p>

					<p>Suitable applications include hospitals, aged care facilities, public buildings, schools, commercial and residential buildings. </p>

					<p>The internal mechanics and blind system are completely sealed within the unit, heightening safety and providing a sterile environment for those residing or working within the building.</p>
