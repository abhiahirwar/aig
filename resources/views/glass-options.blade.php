              <p>Laminated panes of glass are assembled from two sheets of glass sandwiching an interlayer, providing greater safety and security.
Speciality interlayers can be specified to reduce UV and solar heat gain, improve thermal performance, address wind load in cyclonic areas, and more.</p>
